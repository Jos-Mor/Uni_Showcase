## üéì Academic Context

These projects span from 2nd to 4th year coursework, covering:
- **Systems Programming** (C, file systems, parallel computing)
- **Machine Learning & AI** (Python, neural networks, survival analysis)
- **Cloud Computing** (Java, Azure, microservices)
- **Database Systems** (Oracle, SQL, web applications)
- **Computer Graphics** (WebGL, shaders, 3D rendering)

Each project folder contains its own detailed README with technical specifications, setup instructions, and implementation details.
