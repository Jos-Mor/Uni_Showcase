The Ultimate squid guide.

By porco rosso.

Who am i? Someone who will post some of my video’s in the future here on CRT, of my setup and of my runs. When, or whether I will do it? Fuck knows. Maybe I wont. I’ve been a lurker for a long time and didn’t post shit because cops can and will find you by your video’s. But aged material might do just fine. Maybe. Maybe. I post this because I see many squids doing stupid shit and getting caught. With these rules your chance of getting caught is very slim, as long as there are no choppers around. Those things are gnarly.

Well kids, its time. First some disclaimers. If you value your life, or give just the smallest shit if you live or die, don’t do this. This is extremely dangerous and can be lethal not only for you but for some sorry schmunk crossing the road and kissing your rocket so hard his atoms become small black holes.

For other adrenaline junkies, psychopaths and other trash of the society, read on.

IMPORTANT: this guide is for full squid only, like running reds wheeling and being an utter ass. If you go 10 above or something, just pull over. 

 
1:Motorcycle.

Here you have 2 choices, the beautiful thing about squidding is its exactly like the theorem of Darwin, the one with the best collection of attributes survives.1 golden attribute is not all, and you will FAIL if you focus on that. What do I mean? Crotch rockets like 1400kawasaki’s and hayabrosas are useful, but less than ideal when doing the squid. You will understand me later in the text. So, what do you need? 2 options here, a liter lightweight modern crotch rocket capable of at least 180 freedom units of velocity or 300 eurofags. This gives you a possibility to lose most pigs on the top speed run with the capability to change direction quickly in the twisties. R1, zx10r, gsxr1000, you know the drill.

Second option is a off-road capable super moto dirt bike. Utter shit top speed but the capability to go off road will leave most pigs pooping their pants. Just know where you are going, otherwise they will just wait you up at the exit of the dirt road ahead.

MOTORCYCLEMODS:


The most important part of the guide, everything here is extremely important to have, everything has its purpose: keeping your ass out of jail. 1:paint. BLACK BLACK BLACK BLACK BLACK BLACK. Have I said black already? No? Black. Extremely difficult to see in the dark and the low contrast keeps you out of the sight of the pig. Matte black is best. If you want to have a sellable bike afterwards or keeping it more or less stock, use plastidip.
2Flippable plate: mechanism that flips your plate is very important for the following reasons: when not squidding it can be held up at night for a roadrun without the worry of getting flashed. It can be used as a coffiecup holder when having a cigarette break. It pisses the cops off, but not too much. Why? Read on.

3:stolen/false plates: This was one of the key thing why I always got away ( or at least have until now). Leave your plate down when being an ass, when the pigs come flashing flip it up (with the idea that maybe they haven’t seen it) They will think that the plate is real(because you just flipped it up). Most of the time they will break off the chase when it becomes too dangerous with the idea that they have your plate anyway. NEVER DRIVE LIKE AN UTTER IDIOT WITH YOUR OWN PLATE!

4: Tail light switch: switch that will turn off all your rear lights, saved my ass bunch of times when road running at night. You become completely invisible to the cops and most ghetto birds unless they have thermal. Otherwise top speed run, or bust. No supermoto has ever lost a ghetto bird on its own.

5:exhaust. Stock or something that even quieter than that. Most race pipes can be heard from miles away, bad thing when running. Keeping a low profile is key, and this is a very important piece.

6: tires: As sticky as humanly possible, however I never tried slicks so there is that. NEVER SQUID in the rain. Cars will always win in the grip compartment in the wet, just never do it. Corsa diablo, pilot power or something like that will do nicely.

7: Navigation: Many runs end badly because squid panics and loses direction. Never panic and never ever lose direction. Always have your navi directed to your save house and when shit hits the fan run like hell. Zumo or tomtom, I don’t give a shit as long as the maps are up to date and the thing is operating like well-oiled 4 banger. 8: Optional GOPRO: best camera, period. Many mounts and many options with arguably best quality picture on the market right now. Sony is good too. Use the stick it mounts, Ive tested them to 200mph, they hold, BUT! Don’t stick it to your head. Too much wind interference at high speeds. Gas tank or chest will do.

CLOTHES GEAR: Black, ATTGATT OR a fucking French hat with a fabulous mustache, it doesn’t really matter. With the speeds you’ll be riding, no gear going to save you. Something dark and something comfortable, but very very rigit. At speeds above 160mph, your backpack loose strings will hit like hammers. Everything needs to be very secure, your navigation, your backpack everything.

BACKUP PLANS: All this is optional, and never tested by me as I never needed it. But if they case you to the ground these might be useful.

• Backpack with a dark colored hoodie, but different than black. Purple or something. Worked perfectly in my hooligan days. -gasoline, 1 gallon in small squirt it like bottles (thus keep a spare key in the gas tank keyhole at all times. Usefull when refueling on the run.

• Have some caltrop in your pockets, usefull when a cop is being a unusually sticky fucker. THIS WILL PISS THEM OFF TO THE LIMIT, this should be plan Y, when plan Z is to pull out a gun and shoot. Don’t use guns, cops will gun you down. -motorcycle sheet, preferably an aged one. This when you lost the cops and put the motorcycle away, pull over the sheet and put on the different color hoodie. And just chill out and walk away. Get your bike in a couble of days.

DO’s and Don’ts

DO: -always know the surroundings up to a point, if the navi fails you still need to know the directions. A small compass on the bars will suffice. Also plant the running route up to a point and put in some “pig catchers” things where a bike can pass but cars cant. Afterwards change direction a couple of times and do a cool down for 2 minutes, after which you can start running home.

-always keep her filled up, gas up every 50 miles or as often as possible. My rocket will drink a full tank at top speed in 10 minutes, just enough to lose a ghetto bird.

-Always keep your bike in top mechanical condition, failure here is not a option.

-use rip off stickers for your helmet, if the bugs pile up too much.

Change directions as often as possible, pigs keep up your direction with radio, changing the direction throws them off like hell.

DON’T

-DON’T flip off pigs, pull your pants down or disrespect the pigs, just run. They are still humans, and they will be very angry humans if you will do that. Just don’t. Just run.

-Don’t shit where you eat, don’t squid where you live. Period. -Don’t run when cops has seen your own plate, just pull over.

THE FINE LINE OF THE LIVING SQUID -stay away from busy residential areas, cops might think that you are too much of a danger and just flat out run you over. You need to stay in a thin line of having squiddly fun and being dangerous enough to let you go and you being such big of a danger for people around you that cops shoot you or run you over.

If i forgot something please do correct me. Excuse my english, not my native language.
